# leetcode 

This is the project that I practice 'Python' programming on the Leetcode.

Hi,welcome to my github.

I am learning the programming skill from doing some subjects from the awesome plantform : "Leetcode".

I also like to share how I could solved the problem by some beautiful algorithm.

Some of the topics are preety hard , so I reference some other people's idea and mix with mine.

Hope you could enjoy coding on all the topics in Leetcode ,Let's moving foreward together!!

If some thing wrong,feel free to email me....you know my email.

Maybe I will practice 'C++' soon before I graduate from NTNU ....maybe...hope i will have more time!!
