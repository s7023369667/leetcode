# leetcode 

This is the project that I practice 'Python' programming on the Leetcode.

Hi,welcome to my github.

I am learning the programming skill from doing some subjects in the awesome plantform : "Leetcode".

I also like to share how I could solve the problems by using some beautiful algorithms.

Some of the topics are preety hard , so I reference other people's ideas/solutions and mix with mine.

Hope you could enjoy coding on all the topics in Leetcode ,let us moving foreward together!!

If there are some thing wrong code ,feel free to email me....since you only know my email.

Maybe I will practice 'C++' soon before I graduate from NTNU 
                  
...maybe...Hope I will have more time and energy to do it!!
